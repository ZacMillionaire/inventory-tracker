# Code of practice
You can consider these as general guidelines. If you don't want to read you can stop after the following section.

---

Everyone who contributes does so by their own desire to do so, as little or as much as they want. You aren't expected to be here and you're not expected to stay. All that's expected is that you're a decent person willing to take on new ideas and bring new ideas to the project and yourself and communicate with trust and respect. Don't be a piece of shit and you'll fit in fine. If the words, "Trans rights are human rights", upsets you then feel free to fuck off.

## Don't be an Australian Word
You know the word. We can say it but we aren't going to write it down.

Don't be a bigot. If you've got hot takes either keep them to yourself forever or fuck off forever. If it becomes known that you have hot takes either between private interactions or publicly you will also be expected to fuck off forever. Don't give a shit how skilled you are if you make others unsafe if they have differing view points. To cut off anyone thinking about being clever about it, arguments about anything in the current American political sphere against human rights is actually just a different view point can go sealion elsewhere. Not limited to American politics either, it's just a really good western example that everyone will feel the effects of for generations.

We make mistakes and missteps from time to time and we understand. Do your best and be better. If you find yourself making a mistake like this you don't need to grovel, just a quick apology is fine.

We also don't do witch hunts. Either for bigotry or skills. If you feel like you're being singled out in pull requests, the first thing you can do (as difficult as it is), is to take a step back and go out and take a breath and maybe touch some grass. Once you've done that, come back and read each comment in the context of improving either the code to align it to better practice or share knowledge.
## Communication
We follow [conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) when doing reviews but we also all have different ways of communicating. Be reasonable with your communication and don't be aggressive. Each review comment is a chance to share knowledge or align to current coding standards or designs.

The standards or designs are evolving and may change but we're accepting of new ideas that aren't drastic changes without discussion first.

In general swearing is fine, we can pretend to be professional but I'm willing to bet everyone swears at work, so if you have a swear in your comments and it's not not a slur or directed at someone specifically then yeah, let out some frustrations in good fun. If we can't own our bad code from the past and improve it in the future then you're probably not going to enjoy your stay.
## Trust
All contributors to this project are trusted to follow the code of practice, and everyone is trusted to understand recommended vs required, and trusted to be able to discuss any improvements. You can be a junior or a seasoned senior, in high school or in retirement we don't really care.

Your skills might place you at a perceived level above others, and you may be an SME for some aspects, but at all points your knowledge and contributions will be documented and shared as much as possible so that anyone can drop in and drop out and no knowledge is lost.
## We're Creative
Diversity of thought is encouraged and while we might document practices to follow, if you have a good idea that goes against the grain because you feel its better, shoot your shot anyway and make your case in the description for your pull request. We don't want to be a monoculture like the Cavendish banana, but at the same time make your choice early before you spend ages on it only to have your contribution rejected.

We'd like to avoid this where possible, but we also don't want to review pull requests that change 200 files in massive ways without some previous agreement about it.

## This isn't a Democracy
This isn't a democracy, it's a project owned by an Australian.

There's no voting to oust people, nor does there need to be an agreement for certain decisions to be made.

End of the day your contributions are entirely made out of your own desire to contribute, but the current owner of this repository is free to do whatever they please with the project and prevent anyone displaying undesired behaviours.

Your input and viewpoints are always appreciated and welcomed but if you're being an `Australian Word`, you'll get the Australian treatment.
