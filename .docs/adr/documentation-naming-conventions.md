# Naming Conventions for Files

## Status
Accepted
## Description
Outlines a naming standard for files and folders within the `.docs` folder. Code related directories are not in scope, but may share similarities.
## Decision
Within the `.docs` folder, the following rules apply
- Folder names **must** be `lower-snake-case`
- File names **may be** `lower-snake-case`, `lower_underscore_case`, or a mix of either where the usage makes a title more distinct and clear
- File names using mixed case **should** be avoided where possible
- File name casing **should** be consistent per folder
- Additional dot folders **must** not be created
