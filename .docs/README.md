This directory is intended to be managed and read with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). You can contribute to this in a raw form of course, but just make sure you read the structure and flow of files.

# Contributing
Read the [[Code of Practice]].
# ADR
Contains all ADRs that are considered things that are "set in stone". These may be things regarding naming, branch or commit styles, to less subjective things such as library decisions or specific patterns in use.

While they're "set in stone", the purpose of ADRs is to capture discussions and the decisions that went into them, which means they're open to being challenged or revisited.
# Architecture
Contains anything to do with technical choices. These are mostly living documents but over time will build up a clear set of designs for various aspects of the project.
# Planning
Where good documentation goes to die. Documents from here are generally from ad-hoc discussions or any other thoughts that build into other more structured documentation.

Files probably won't be deleted from this folder, but they might be at any point as they drift too far out of date as decisions are made or features are developed.
